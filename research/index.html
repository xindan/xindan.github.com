	<h2>Research</h2>
    <p>Central to the life process is the accurate replication of DNA and the faithful segregation of newly replicated DNA sister copies to daughter cells. My graduate research was focused on understanding how <i>E. coli</i> organizes and segregates its chromosome. By simultaneously tracking pairwise combinations of genetic loci, I discovered that the left and right chromosome arms reside in opposite halves of the cell with the replication origin between them. This finding marked the beginning of my scientific path.</p>
    <p>My postdoctoral studies have focused on how <i>Bacillus subtilis</i> organizes and segregates its chromosome. I found that <i>B. subtilis</i> chromosome flows a usual choreography and oscillates between two disparate patterns during every cell cycle. My studies revealed that the partitioning system and condensin complex are the drivers for this oscillatory cycle.</p>
    <p>My current research combines classic and modern molecular, genetic and imaging approaches to study the contribution of a set of highly conserved factors in bacterial chromosome biology. Taking the many strengths of studying bacteria, my goal is to uncover general principles of chromosome organization and segregation in all domains of life.</p>
