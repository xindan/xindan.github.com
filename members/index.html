            <p>I am a biologist fascinated by the beauty and complexity of the microscopic world. To a large degree, cells are like tiny black boxes. We are groping in an area that has not yet been fully illuminated. I hope I can let in a thin beam of light to penetrate the box. I am doing my best.</p>

            <p>I was studying Human Biology with a minor in Chemistry in college. I recently became fascinated with the world of microbiology and here I am! Most of my work includes molecular cloning and lab maintenance. When I’m not in the lab, I like to read, hike, and go out at night with my telescope to spot the constellations.</p>

            <p class="member-role">Undergraduate Student</p>
            <p>I am an undergraduate student majoring in Human Biology. Molecular Biology is like a mystery that attracts me to explore more about it. I’m passionate to learn the molecular basis of chromosome replication and segregation so here I am. In my spare time, I enjoy playing piano, baking cakes and traveling to see different cultures.</p>

            </ul>
            <p>I am a graduate student in the Microbiology program. I did my Bachelor’s in Microbiology with minors in Physics and Chemistry. I went on to do my Master’s in Life Sciences. My fascination with the bacterial world began in my undergrad years, when I discovered that bacteria survive and evolve against all odds and versatile nature. I am interested in the mechanisms and functions of bacteria, specifically how their chromosomes work under various conditions. I study chromosome packaging, and the various elements involved in carrying out this intricate process. Outside the lab, I love to read, travel and explore new cuisines from around the world.</p>

            <p>I am a graduate student in the GCDB program. I became interested in chromosome biology because chromosomes provide the blueprint for all life. Inside the lab, I study chromosome folding and dynamics using <i>Bacillus subtilis</i> as a model organism. Specifically, I am looking into how the SMC condensin complex contributes to chromosome organization and segregation. Outside of the lab, I like playing basketball, playing video games and reading.</p>

            <p class="member-role">Undergraduate Student</p>
            <p>I am an undergraduate student pursuing majors in both Biology and Philosophy. I often say that I’m passionate about biology the same way some people are passionate about art or music – the inherent beauty that not only surrounds us but also sustains us is an incredible mystery with awe-inspiring magnificence and complexity. During my time outside of lab, I serve as an Associate Justice on the IUSA Supreme Court, work as a Representative of the IU Office of Admissions, and enjoy reading, cooking, and watching Netflix Originals.</p>

            <p>I am an undergraduate student majoring in Biology and Psychology and minoring in Chemistry. My work in the lab centers around spontaneous suppressors that rescue mutants deficient in DNA replication. Outside of the lab, I strive to make an impact in my community through work with IU’s student government and Hoosier Hills Food Bank. In my free time, I enjoy cooking with friends and playing the violin.</p>
