	<h2>About me</h2>
	<p>I am a loving daughter, a caring friend, a growing scientist. </p>
	<p>I was born and raised in Northeast China, did my first degree in Shanghai, then here in Oxford I discovered my inner geek was to make living bugs glow and see them in the dark. </p>
	<p>I love food and enjoy cooking. I am not addicted to chocolates and lollipops as much as I used to, but I still can't resist ice-cream. </p>
	<p>I love beautiful shoes but unfortunately my feet are too small for them. I must wear comfy ones so that they can take me wherever I want to go.  </p>
	<p>In no particular order, I like Forrest Gump, the Beatles, Bon Jovi, the Cranberries, postcards, souvenir shops, a key ring with a shoe on it, a book that makes me smile and a movie that makes me cry. </p>
