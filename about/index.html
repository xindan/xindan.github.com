    <h2>About me</h2>
    <p>I am a loving daughter, a caring friend, a growing scientist.</p>
    <p>I was born and raised in Northeast China, did my first degree in Shanghai, then in grad school at Oxford I discovered my inner geek was to make living bugs glow and see them in the dark, and here I am.</p>
    <p>I love food and enjoy cooking.</p>
    <p>I love comfy shoes so that they can take me wherever I want to go.</p>
    <p>In no particular order, I like Forrest Gump, the Beatles, Bon Jovi, the Cranberries, postcards, souvenir shops, a key ring with a shoe on it, a book that makes me smile and a movie that makes me cry.</p>
